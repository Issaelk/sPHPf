#sPHPf (Simple PHP Framework)
### Making your life simple and better.

sPHPf is a PHP 5.3 based framework that allows you to initiate a fast developement
to whatever application you're interested using my personal view of MVC implementation.

The point features of this framework is the use of the Twig template manager and RedBean database
management. A good feature is also that due to it's simplicity you can always
switch between other template engines or database engines in an easy way.

You can obviously see more information of this framework in the webpage.
